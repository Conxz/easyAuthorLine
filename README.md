## Project Description
Team neuroscience is becoming increasingly common in today’s research. Along with this trend, the number of individuals involved in one project/paper is also increasing to hundreds and even thousands. Preparation of author block for such papers becomes a challenging job. Particularly, if it is done manually, to format the author affiliations is painful when co-authors ask for some updates. 
The basic idea of this project is to make an easy generator of author line. With such a tool, researchers could easily generate an author line which integrating authors’ first and last names, affiliations, and, when needed, information of highest degree and email address. 
Given recent big success of team neuroscience studies, we expect that this tool would be very useful for future large-scale studies.
